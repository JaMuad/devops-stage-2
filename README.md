# Full-Stack FastAPI and React Template

Welcome to the Full-Stack FastAPI and React template repository. This repository serves as a demo application for interns, showcasing how to set up and run a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a ReactJS frontend using ChakraUI.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- **frontend**: Contains the ReactJS application.
- **backend**: Contains the FastAPI application and PostgreSQL database integration.

Each directory has its own README file with detailed instructions specific to that part of the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, please follow the instructions in the respective directories:

- [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md)
- [Backend README](./backend/README.md)

# PROJECT CONTENT AFTER FORKED: Dockerized Full Stack Web Application Deployment

## Project Summary

### Dockerfiles

- **Dockerfile.backend**:
  - Created to define the backend container environment.
  - Ensured that all dependencies and configurations were properly set up for the FastAPI application.

- **Dockerfile.frontend**:
  - Created to define the frontend container environment.
  - Configured to ensure that the React application could be built and deployed effectively.

### Docker Compose Configuration

- **docker-compose.yml**:
  - Configured to define and orchestrate the services needed for the application.
  - Included the following services:
    - **Traefik**: Acts as a reverse proxy to route traffic to appropriate services.
    - **Backend**: FastAPI application.
    - **Frontend**: React application.
    - **Database**: PostgreSQL instance.
    - **Adminer**: Database management tool.

### Services and Routes

- **Traefik**: Handles routing and SSL certificate management.
- **Backend**: FastAPI application running on port 8000.
- **Frontend**: React application running on port 4173.
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Manages the application data.
- **Adminer**: Database management tool running on port 8080.

### URLs

| Service    | URL                          |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Main Domain| [muadmaalim.buzz](http://muadmaalim.buzz) |
| Frontend   | [www.muadmaalim.buzz](http://www.muadmaalim.buzz) |
| Proxy      | [proxy.muadmaalim.buzz](http://proxy.muadmaalim.buzz) |
| Database   | [db.muadmaalim.buzz](http://db.muadmaalim.buzz) |

### Work In Progress

- `muadmaalim.buzz/api`
- `muadmaalim.buzz/docs`
- `muad.buzz/redoc`

## Requirements and Setup

### 1. Fork the Repository
- Create a fork of this repository to add the necessary Docker and proxy configuration files.

### 2. Dockerization
- Write Dockerfiles to containerize both the React frontend and FastAPI backend.
- Ensure each service can be built and run locally in their respective containers.

### 3. Proxy Configuration
- Configure Traefik to:
  - Serve the frontend and backend on the same host machine port (80).
  - Serve the frontend on the root (/).
  - Proxy `/api` on the backend to `/api` on the main domain.
  - Proxy `/docs` on the backend to `/docs` on the main domain.
  - Proxy `/redoc` on the backend to `/redoc` on the main domain.

### 4. Database Configuration
- Configure the application to use a PostgreSQL database.
- Ensure the database is properly set up and connected.

### 5. Adminer Setup
- Configure Adminer to run on port 8080.
- Ensure Adminer is accessible via the subdomain `db.muadmaalim.buzz` and is properly connected to the PostgreSQL database.

### 6. Cloud Deployment
- Deploy your Dockerized application to an AWS EC2 instance.
- Set up a domain for your application. If you don't have a domain, get a free subdomain from Afraid DNS.
- Configure HTTP to redirect to HTTPS.
- Configure `www` to redirect to non-www.

## Testing and Evaluation

- Your hosted application will be tested to ensure it meets all the requirements.
- Your repository will be tested to ensure it works correctly after running `docker-compose up -d`.

## Additional Instructions

- Improve all README files with detailed instructions on how to deploy the app, both manually and using Docker.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
